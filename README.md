# Sayur Lokal - Fresh. Local. Sustainable.

Sayur Lokal is a digital platform that brings the warmth and goodness of local markets into modern homes. We make it easy for families to access fresh, locally sourced meal prepsâ€”delivered straight to their doorstep with minimal environmental impact.

## About the Project

Sayur Lokal connects households with local farmers and food artisans to deliver ready-to-cook or ready-to-eat meal preps made from fresh, local ingredients. By using eco-friendly packaging and our own optimized delivery service, we offer a convenient, sustainable alternative to traditional food delivery.

### Key Features

- **Eco-conscious**: Compostable, reusable, and recyclable packaging only
- **Local-first**: All products are sourced from verified local farms and artisans
- **Meal-prep focused**: Curated weekly menus for various dietary needs (e.g., family packs, vegetarian, quick meals)
- **Eco Impact Tracker**: See the CO2 saved per order and earn green points

### How It Works

1. **Browse**: Choose from curated meal-prep bundles or individual fresh products
2. **Order**: Place an order via mobile/desktop
3. **Package**: Items are sourced, packed with sustainable materials
4. **Deliver**: Delivered to your door via Sayur Lokal's private eco-friendly delivery network
5. **Review & Earn**: Leave a review, track your impact, and earn eco points

## Target Market

- **Secondary**: Eco-conscious individuals, young couples, health enthusiasts, and meal planners
