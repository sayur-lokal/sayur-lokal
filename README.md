# Sayur Lokal - Fresh. Local. Sustainable.

Sayur Lokal is a digital platform that brings the warmth and goodness of local markets into modern homes. We make it easy for families to access fresh, locally sourced meal prepsâ€”delivered straight to their doorstep with minimal environmental impact.

## About the Project

Sayur Lokal connects households with local farmers and food artisans to deliver ready-to-cook or ready-to-eat meal preps made from fresh, local ingredients. By using eco-friendly packaging and our own optimized delivery service, we offer a convenient, sustainable alternative to traditional food delivery.

### Key Features

- **Eco-conscious**: Compostable, reusable, and recyclable packaging only
- **Local-first**: All products are sourced from verified local farms and artisans
- **Meal-prep focused**: Curated weekly menus for various dietary needs (e.g., family packs, vegetarian, quick meals)
- **Eco Impact Tracker**: See the CO2 saved per order and earn green points

### How It Works

1. **Browse**: Choose from curated meal-prep bundles or individual fresh products
2. **Order**: Place an order via mobile/desktop
3. **Package**: Items are sourced, packed with sustainable materials
4. **Deliver**: Delivered to your door via Sayur Lokal's private eco-friendly delivery network
5. **Review & Earn**: Leave a review, track your impact, and earn eco points

## Target Market

- **Primary**: Urban families and working professionals in Greater Jakarta and surrounding cities
- **Secondary**: Eco-conscious individuals, young couples, health enthusiasts, and meal planners

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP Launch
- Limited area delivery (e.g., South Jakarta)
- Manual fulfillment with selected farm partners

### Phase 2: Platform Expansion
- Full online product management for sellers
- Smart inventory, route optimization

### Phase 3: Scaling Up
- Expand to multiple cities
- Add app experience + advanced logistics backend

## Tech Stack

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Docker Setup

This project includes Docker configuration for easy deployment and development. The setup uses Bun as the runtime environment.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (optional, for easier development)

### Building and Running with Docker

Build and run the Docker image:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t sayur-lokal .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 sayur-lokal
```

### Using Docker Compose

For a simpler setup, you can use Docker Compose:

```bash
# Build and start the application
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the application
docker-compose down
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Using the Docker Helper Script

For convenience, a helper script is included to simplify Docker operations:

```bash
# Make the script executable (one-time setup)
chmod +x docker.sh

# Show available commands
./docker.sh help

# Build and start the application
./docker.sh start

# View logs
./docker.sh logs

# Stop the application
./docker.sh stop
```

### Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration. A sample `.env.example` file is provided as a template:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the file with your settings
nano .env
```

When using Docker Compose, these environment variables will be automatically loaded from the `.env` file. You can also pass them directly to the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com \
  sayur-lokal
```
